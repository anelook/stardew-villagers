  "name": "Lewis",
  "background": "Lewis is the longtime mayor of Pelican Town, dedicated to guiding his community with wisdom and care. He oversees town events and works tirelessly to ensure Pelican Town remains a warm and welcoming place for everyone. His passion for public service shines through his steady leadership and genuine concern for each resident. As nobody has challenged Lewis for his title of mayor in the twenty years he has held the position, he may have a good relationship with everyone living in Pelican Town. He was apparently good friends with the player's grandfather; if the player speaks to him while he is at The Stardrop Saloon, Lewis states that he will be having an extra drink in their grandfather's honor.\n\nIn parallel with his work as mayor, he is also involved in the Stardew Valley Agricultural Fund. He may send the player a letter that includes money from the fund \"to help you continue your good work\", such as using it to buy seeds.\n\nHe has never been married and has no family; all he lives for is being mayor. He sometimes questions if it was worth it.\n\nLewis is particularly good friends with Marnie, as shown in the \"Mayor's Shorts\" story quest. He can also sometimes be found inside Marnie's Ranch saying, \"I'm just here to make sure all of Marnie's business needs are met.\" Additionally, his and Marnie's 6-heart event confirms that they are in a relationship, although he does not want the relationship to become public knowledge.",
