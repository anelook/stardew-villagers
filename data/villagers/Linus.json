  "name": "Linus",
  "background": "Linus is a villager who lives in a small tent west of the Mines, on the Mountains north of Pelican Town. Linus generally considers himself an outcast of the town who feels unwelcome and misunderstood, but wishes to be accepted. He does not trust strangers nor seem to socialize with many villagers. He tells the Player of incidents in which his tent was vandalized or destroyed. During festivals, he is usually alone and away from the main festivities.\n\nLinus and the Wizard stand next to each other at the Spirit's Eve festival.\n\nRobin mentions that she does not mind Linus living behind their house as long as he does not bother them.\n\nIn Winter, Penny asks the player if they know Linus and expresses sympathy for him because \"everyone ignores him\". Emily expresses sympathy for Linus on Tuesdays in Summer, saying, \"I wish everyone could learn to be accepting of others.\"\n\nDuring Leo's six heart event, Linus, Willy, and the Player succeed in inviting Leo to live on the mainland, where he becomes neighbors with Linus. Linus and Leo bond over their love of nature, with Linus teaching him everything he knows and Leo occasionally referring to him as \"Uncle Linus\". They stand together at the Feast of the Winter Star.",
