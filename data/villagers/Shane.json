  "background": "Shane is a villager in Pelican Town who is often rude and unhappy, is a heavy drinker, and suffers from depression. However, his attitude starts to change toward any player who chooses to befriend him. He works at JojaMart most days between 9am and 5pm unless the Community Center is completed, and he frequently spends his evenings in The Stardrop Saloon. He doesn't work on the weekend except on rainy days, and is frequently around Marnie's ranch..\n\n Shane lives at his aunt Marnie's ranch with his goddaughter Jas. He works at JojaMart (unless the Community Center is completed), and Morris is his manager there.\n\nDuring the Flower Dance, he will dance with Emily if neither of them are dancing with the player.",
