  "name": "Professor Snail ",
  "background": "Professor Snail lives on Ginger Island and runs the Island Field Office. Before freeing him, Professor Snail is trapped in a cave on the northeastern side of the Dig Site. The Dig Site is accessible to the player by paying the parrots Golden Walnut.png 10 Golden Walnuts to repair the bridge near the field office. Once the bridge has been repaired, he can be freed with any explosion (from a bomb or Explosive Ammo). One hit with any slingshot works, but the player must aim carefully.\n\nAfter freeing him, he explains that he has been conducting a survey of the island's flora and fauna for a year. He returns to his tent on Ginger Island, where he accepts donations in exchange for Golden Walnuts.\n\nThe cave where he was trapped becomes a mushroom cave, where mushrooms can be foraged by the player.",
